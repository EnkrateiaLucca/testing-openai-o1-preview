However, their performance can be compromised in data science sce-\\nnarios that require real-time data adjustment, expertise in optimization due to\\ncomplex dependencies among various tasks, and the ability to identify logical\\nerrors for precise reasoning. In this study, we introduce the Data Interpreter, a\\nsolution designed to solve with code that emphasizes three pivotal techniques to\\naugment problem-solving in data science: 1) dynamic planning with hierarchical\\ngraph structures for real-time data adaptability; 2) tool integration dynamically\\nto enhance code proficiency during execution, enriching the requisite expertise;\\n3) logical inconsistency identification in feedback, and efficiency enhancement\\nthrough experience recording. We evaluate the Data Interpreter on various data\\nscience and real-world tasks. Compared to open-source baselines, it demonstrated\\nsuperior performance, exhibiting significant improvements in machine learning\\ntasks, increasing from 0.86 to 0.95. Additionally, it showed a 26% increase in the\\nMATH dataset and a remarkable 112% improvement in open-ended tasks. The\\nsolution will be released at https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT.\\n1 I NTRODUCTION\\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have enabled agents to excel in a wide range of applications,\\ndemonstrating their adaptability and effectiveness (Guo et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2023a; Zhou\\net al., 2023b). These LLM-powered agents have significantly influenced areas like software engi-\\nneering (Hong et al., 2023), navigating complex open-world scenarios (Wang et al., 2023; Chen\\net al., 2024a), facilitating collaborative multi-agent structures for multimodal tasks (Zhuge et al.,\\n2023), improving the responsiveness of virtual assistants (Lu et al., 2023), optimizing group intelli-\\ngence (Zhuge et al., 2024), and contributing to scientific research (Tang et al., 2024).\\nRecent studies focused on improving the problem-solving capabilities of these agents by improving\\ntheir reasoning process, aiming for increased sophistication and efficiency (Zhang et al., 2023; Besta\\net al., 2023; Sel et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2024; Wei et al., 2022). However, data-centric scientific\\nproblems, including machine learning, data analysis, and mathematical problem-solving, present\\nunique challenges that remain to be addressed. The machine learning process involves complex,\\nlengthy task handling steps, characterized by intricate dependencies among multiple tasks. This\\n∗These authors contributed equally to this work.\\n†The authors are listed in alphabetical order.\\n‡Chenglin Wu (E-mail: alexanderwu@deepwisdom.ai), is the corresponding author.\\n1arXiv:2402.18679v3  [cs.AI]  12 Mar 2024\\n\\nFigure 1: Comparison with various open-source frameworks on machine learning tasks and real-\\nworld open-ended tasks.\\nrequires expert intervention for process optimization and dynamic adjustment in the event of failure\\nor data updates. It is often challenging for LLMs to provide the correct solution in a single attempt.\\nFurthermore, these problems demand precise reasoning, and thorough data verification (Romera-\\nParedes et al., 2023), which poses additional challenges to the LLM-based agent framework.\\nMoreover, existing works such as (Qiao et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2023; Lucas, 2023) address data-\\ncentric problems through code-based problem-solving methods, known as the interpreter paradigm,\\nwhich combines static requirement decomposition with code execution. However, several key chal-\\nlenges arise when employing these frameworks in practical data science tasks: 1) Data dependence\\nintensity: The complexity inherent in data science arises from the intricate interplay among various\\nsteps, which are subject to real-time changes (Liu et al., 2021). For accurate results, data cleaning and\\ncomprehensive feature engineering are prerequisites before developing any machine learning model.\\nTherefore, it is critical to monitor data changes and dynamically adjust to the transformed data and\\nvariables. The machine learning modeling process, encompassing feature selection, model training,\\nand evaluation, involves a broad spectrum of processing operators and search spaces (Zheng et al.,\\n2021). The challenge lies in generating and resolving the entire process code simultaneously. 2)\\nRefined domain knowledge : The specialized knowledge and coding practices of data scientists are\\npivotal in addressing data-related challenges. Typically embedded in proprietary code and data, this\\nknowledge often remains inaccessible to current LLMs. For instance, generating code for data trans-\\nformation in specific domains such as energy or geology may pose a challenge for LLMs without the\\nrequisite domain expertise. Existing methodologies predominantly depend on LLMs, a reliance that\\nmay streamline the process but potentially compromise performance. 3) Rigorous logic require-\\nments : Currently, interpreters such as (Qiao et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2023; Lucas, 2023) incorporate\\ncode execution and error capturing capabilities to enhance problem-solving performance. However,\\nthey often neglect error-free execution, erroneously considering it as correct. While basic program-\\nming tasks can be streamlined and depend on immediate execution feedback when requirements\\nare delineated, data science problems often pose ambiguous, irregular, and not well-defined require-\\nments, making it difficult for LLMs to understand. Consequently, LLM-generated code solutions for\\ntask resolution may contain ambiguities that necessitate rigorous validation of logical soundness,\\nextending beyond mere execution feedback.\\nTo address the aforementioned challenges, we introduce an LLM-based agent, called the Data In-\\nterpreter, designed specifically for the field of data science. This agent follows a plan-code-verify\\napproach to fulfill human requirements by breaking down tasks, executing code, and verifying feed-\\nback. Specifically, we propose 1) Dynamic planning with hierarchical structure : Our Data Inter-\\npreter employs hierarchical graph structures to comprehend the inherent complexities of data science\\nmore effectively. A dynamic planning approach equips it with the adaptability to task variations,\\n2\\n\\nproving especially efficient in monitoring data changes and managing intricate variable dependen-\\ncies inherent in data science problems. 2) Tool utilization and generation : We enhance coding\\nproficiency by integrating various human-authored code snippets, and creating custom tools for spe-\\ncific tasks beyond mere API-focused capabilities. This process involves the automatic combination\\nof diverse tools with self-generated code. It utilizes task-level execution to independently build and\\nexpand its tool library, simplify tool usage, and perform code restructuring as needed. 3) Enhanc-\\ning reasoning with logic bug aware : This is based on the confidence score derived from execution\\nresults and test-driven validations, which are essential for an exception-free scenario. It detects in-\\nconsistencies between the code solution and test code execution and compares multiple trials to\\nreduce logic errors. Throughout the execution and reasoning process, task-level experiences, pri-\\nmarily comprising metadata and runtime trajectory, which include both successes and failures, are\\nrecorded.\\nAs depicted in Figure 1, our Data Interpreter significantly surpasses existing open-source frame-\\nworks. Compared to these baselines, the Data Interpreter exhibits superior performance, with 10.3%\\n(from 0.86 to 0.95) improvement in machine learning tasks and 26% enhancement on the MATH\\ndataset, demonstrating robust problem-solving capabilities. In open-ended tasks, its performance has\\nmore than doubled, marking a 112% increase, showcasing its efficacy in tackling a wide spectrum\\nof challenges.\\nWe summarize our contributions as follows:\\n• We propose a dynamic planning framework with hierarchical structures, enhancing adapt-\\nability and problem-solving capabilities in data science tasks.\\n• We improve the proficiency and efficiency of coding in LLMs by introducing automated\\ntool integration for tool utilization and generation.\\n• We improve reasoning by integrating verification and experience, thereby enhancing the\\naccuracy and efficiency of problem-solving.\\n• Our experiments demonstrate that our Data Interpreter exceeds existing benchmarks in\\nmachine learning tasks, mathematical problems, and open-ended tasks, thus setting a new\\nstandard for performance.\\n2 R ELATED WORK\\nLLMs as data scientist agents Cutting-edge Large Language Models (LLMs), pre-trained on\\ndiverse natural and programming data, exhibit strong interpretation abilities. Like, (Gao et al., 2023)\\n(Chen et al., 2022) leverages program interpreters to decouple complex computation, (Zhou et al.,\\n2023a) boost their performance on the MATH dataset, and (Hendrycks et al., 2021), (Li et al., 2023),\\n(Liang et al., 2023) enable code-based reasoning capabilities in embodied agents.
